CollectionLogger
================

Dumps descriptions of my media collections to files in the cloud, so I can rebuild them in case of emergency. Music and TV are compacted based on album and season, respectively, while other videos get dumped as is.

Just a toy project, so I can learn some interesting new features and professional skills. Currently rebuilding backend storage to use RDBMS instead of/as well as XML, and a CRUD webapp for frontend.
