CollectionLogger
================

Dumps descriptions of my music/TV/porn collections to files in the cloud, so I can rebuild them in case of emergency. Music and TV are compacted based on album and season, respectively, while other videos get dumped as is.

Just a toy project, so I could learn some interesting new things in C#. LINQ, IEnumerables, some functional programming.

TODO: Add https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp so we can read MP3 tags for data.
TODO: Rewrite to use a separate dump-to-DB-and-XML project/function. Too tightly coupled right now.
